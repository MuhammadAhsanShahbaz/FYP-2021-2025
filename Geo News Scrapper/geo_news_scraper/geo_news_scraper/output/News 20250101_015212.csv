Prince William made headlines when he grew a beard in 2024. Thousands of people admired his new  rugged beard and some people compared his look to his father, King Charles, who also embraced facial hair during his younger years.
But some people were of the view that the prince grew his beard because it helped him hide his facial expression after his father and wife Kate Middleton were diagnosed with cancer.

	

		

	


They believe that beard obscures facial expressions and give the impression of a more serious or contemplative mood, potentially leading to a perception of sadness.
Now that his wife has finished chemotherapy and according to some reports his father is also on the road to recovery, some royal fans are convinced that the Prince of Wales will return to previous clean-shaven look at some point in 2025.
Prince William is the first in line to the British throne and will become the king after Charles.
Charles who waited for decades to become the king was diagnosed with cancer less then two years after he became the monarch."

World,UN condemns Taliban ban on Afghan women working at NGOs,"December 31, 2024",AFP,"An Afghan woman stands by a window in Kabul on January 31, 2024. — AFP
UN human rights chief Volker Turk said Tuesday that Afghanistan's governing Taliban authorities must reverse their ban on Afghan women working for NGOs.
Since the Taliban's return to power in August 2021, women have been progressively erased from public spaces, prompting the United Nations to denounce the ""gender apartheid"" the administration has established.

	

		

	


""I am deeply alarmed at the recent announcement by the de facto authorities in Afghanistan that non-governmental organisations' licenses will be revoked if they continue to employ Afghan women. This is absolutely the wrong path being taken,"" Turk said in a statement.
He said that in a letter dated Thursday, the Taliban's economy ministry ordered national and international NGOs to comply with a decree issued two years ago which bars them from employing Afghan women.
""The humanitarian situation in Afghanistan remains dire, with more than half the population living in poverty. NGOs play a vital role in providing critical life-saving assistance — to Afghan women, men, girls and boys — and this measure will directly impact the ability of the population to receive humanitarian aid,"" said Turk.
""I once again urge the de facto authorities in Afghanistan to revoke this deeply discriminatory decree, and all other measures which seek to eradicate women and girls' access to education, work and public services, including healthcare, and that restrict their freedom of movement.
""No country can progress — politically, economically or socially — while excluding half of its population from public life.
""For the future of Afghanistan, the de facto authorities must change course.""
Since the Taliban's return to power, women have been progressively erased from public spaces, prompting the United Nations to denounce the ""gender apartheid"" the administration has established.
Taliban authorities have banned post-primary education for girls and women, restricted employment and blocked access to parks and other public places.
A recent law prohibits women from singing or reciting poetry in public under the Taliban government's ultra-strict application of Islamic law. It also encourages them to ""veil"" their voices and bodies outside the home.
Some local radio and television stations have also stopped broadcasting female voices."

KARACHI: Majlis Wahdat-e-Muslimeen (MWM) continued to stage its sit-ins against Parachinar crisis in several parts of Karachi, the country’s economic hub, despite crackdown on the protesters by the law enforcement agencies.

	

		

	


Currently, protest demonstrations are being staged at at least nine different locations, paralysing daily life and economic activities in the metropolis.
According to Karachi traffic police, Abul Hasan Isphahani Road, Numaish Chowrangi, Kamran Chowrangi, the road leading to Sohrab Goth from Ancholi, Lasbela, Tower and other areas are closed for traffic due to the sit-ins by the politico-religious party.

Earlier in the evening, the police, following multiple engagements with the protesters, finally launched a crackdown to clear the roads for traffic in the metropolis. 
The protesters pelted stones at police, torched their six motorcycles and a check post at Numaish Chowrangi, prompting the cops to fire tear gas shells and baton-charge activist of the politico-religious party staging sit-in at the Numaish Chowrangi on MA Jinnah Road.
Police also demolished central sit-in camp of the MWM established at Numaish Chowrangi. The law enforcers also took several protesters into custody and shifted them to the police station.

Taking swift notice of the incident, Sindh Chief Minister Murad Ali Shah said that nobody would be allowed to damage public and private property under any circumstances.
Legal action will be taken against those who set vehicles ablaze, vowed the chief minister. He said: “Everyone has the right to protest but damaging civil property is mischief.”
The prolonged protests were not only damaging the country’s economy but  disrupting daily life in the metropolis as people were unable to travel freely.

At Kamran Chowrangi, more police force was summoned as the situation grew tense this morning upon continued blockage of roads.
The senior superintendent of police (SSP) East and Sindh Rangers personnel arrived at the site to end the sit-in but to no avail.
Additionally, the participants of the sit-in at Karman Chowrangi pegged tents, while police tried to negotiate with the protestors, who refused to end the sit-in and open roads.
Earlier, the protests at Five Star Chowrangi, Shamsuddin Azeemi Road, Surjani Town, Ancholi, and Golimar Chowrangi were called off to clear pathways for commuters.
Whereas, police removed obstructions and dispersed protesters from the Abul Hassan Isphani Road after a brief spell of clashes with protesters.
The Sindh CM, while addressing media in Thatta, said the provincial government had last night asked the demonstrators to hold the protest at one place only without disturbing other citizens.
However, he said, they did not fulfil their commitment to end the city-wide protests. The Sindh CM said the ongoing sit-ins at four more places would be removed through administrative action and talks.
""We are not against peaceful protests, nevertheless, they have hurt people,"" he said.
The provincial government sent relief goods for Parachinar as well, he said, adding that the issue of Parachinar would be resolved in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, not here.
Murad said the government was taking action against the sit-ins which might make some people angry. ""It is the government’s responsibility to address it if common men are troubled,"" he said.
Last night, the MWM and a delegation of the Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) addressed the media after a meeting on ongoing protests and sit-ins across the city.
PPP leader Saeed Ghani expressed solidarity with the bereaved families of the Parachinar tragedy victims, saying: ""We are deeply grieved over the incident and extend our condolences to the martyrs' families.""
Paying tribute to the resilience of women and children participating in the protests, the PPP leader remarked: ""We salute their courage.""
He added: ""It is your right to protest."" However, he urged organisers of the protest sit-ins to limit their demonstrations to a single location.
On the occasion, AIG Javed Alam also spoke to the media. According to him, additional security personnel have been deployed across the city to ensure security of the sit-ins.
MWM leader Allama Hassan Zafar Naqvi said: ""We respect your opinion."" However, he noted that it is not possible for him to give a definitive answer right now as various sit-ins have different organisers.
Parachinar, located in Kurram, is a tribal district near the Afghan border with a population of around 600,000. It has long been a hotspot for conflict.
Recent clashes, that erupted in November, have killed at least 130 people and triggered a humanitarian crisis, with shortages of medicine and oxygen exacerbated by the closure of the highway connecting Parachinar to Peshawar."

Business,SSGC cuts gas supply for captive power by 50% in January,"December 31, 2024",Our Correspondent,"A representational image of flames of a lit gas stove. — AFP/File
50% cut replaces full disconnection during peak winter months.
Clause-1 of GSA invoked for supply on ""as available"" basis.
Industries urged to maintain dual-firing arrangements.

	

		

	


KARACHI: The Sui Southern Gas Company (SSGC) has announced a 50% cut in gas supply for captive power generation from January 1 to 31, 2025, citing severe shortages caused by declining reserves, 
The News
 reported.
In a notice issued to industrial associations on Monday, the gas utility emphasised the critical shortfall in indigenous gas supply. 
As per the Ministry of Energy's priority order, the winter demand from domestic consumers, especially in Balochistan, will take precedence.
SSGC stated that the gas curtailment aligns with Clause-1 of the ‘Contract for the Supply of Gas for Power Generation’ (GSA), which stipulates that gas is provided on an ‘as and when available’ basis. The clause also requires consumers to maintain dual-firing arrangements to mitigate production losses during supply shortages.
The contract further specifies that gas supply is generally available from March to November, with disconnections during the peak winter months of December to February. However, instead of a complete disconnection this year, SSGC has opted for a 50% curtailment in January to balance supply for the domestic sector.
The utility urged industrial consumers to cooperate and understand the necessity of these measures, pointing to the importance of ensuring uninterrupted gas supplies for residential customers during the winter season.
Last week, on December 27, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif directed that uninterrupted gas supply to households be ensured immediately.
PM Shehbaz emphasised that providing gas to domestic consumers remains the government’s top priority.
Chairing a meeting held in Islamabad to review the situation of gas supply across the country, the PM, notice of complaints by the domestic consumers, directed to permanently resolve the issue of the shortage of gas supply by bringing reforms in the system structure.
“Providing gas to domestic consumers is the government’s top priority”, the prime minister said.
During the briefing, it was informed that there was a surplus of RLNG (Regasified Liquefied Natural Gas) in the system, leading to improvements in gas load management compared to last year.
The meeting was told that the duration of gas load shedding this year was shorter than last year.
Gas is being provided to domestic consumers from 5 AM to 10 PM, while gas is also being provided to the power sector according to its demand, the meeting was further informed.
Similarly, it was told that online dashboards for consumer complaints by Sui Northern Gas Pipelines Limited (SNGPL) and Sui Southern Gas Company Limited (SSGC) were operational and the complaint resolution rate for SNGPL was 93%, while SSGC’s rate was 79%.
As per the briefing, all gas fields in the country were active.
The meeting was attended by Federal Minister for Economic Affairs Ahmad Khan Cheema, Federal Minister for Petroleum Dr Musadik Malik, the Prime Minister’s Coordinator Rana Ihsan Afzal, and other relevant senior government officials."

KARACHI: The KSE-100 index surged 84% in CY24, ending the year at 115,127 points. This marks the highest return since CY02 when the index posted a staggering 112% gain.
On the last trading session of 2024, stocks stumbled a little and closed with a slight decline of 132 points amid year-end institutional profit-taking.  
The Pakistan Stock Exchange’s (PSX) benchmark KSE-100 index decreased by 0.11% to 115,126.9 points against 115,259 points recorded in the last session. The highest index of the day remained at 116,700.02 points, while the lowest level was recorded at 114,804.81 points.
Ahsan Mehanti, an analyst at Arif Habib Corp, said, “Stocks closed under pressure at the year-end close on institutional profit-taking in over-bought scrips.”
He said that a slump in global equities, subdued economic growth at 0.92% for July-September 2024, security unrest in Karachi and foreign outflows played a catalyst role in the bearish activity. 
The KSE-30 index decreased by 117.50 points or 0.32% to 36,182.41 points against 36,299.91 points.
According to a report by foreign outlet 
Bloomberg
, the KSE-100’s 84% rise makes the index the second-best performer in local currency terms among the more than 90 tracked globally by 
Bloomberg
.
Country watchers expect the boom to continue next year, bolstered by likely more cuts in borrowing costs and easing inflation, while a loan programme from the International Monetary Fund helps to stabilise the economy. The country’s economy expanded more slowly than expected last quarter, but has broadly recovered from 2023 when it narrowly escaped a default, the report said.
According to brokerage firm Arif Habib Limited, during CY24, the KSEAll market capitalisation experienced a growth of 61%, concluding at Rs14.6 trillion, marking the highest-ever closing on CY basis.
It said, on December 16, market capitalisation peaked at an all-time high of Rs14.8 trillion. In terms of USD, market capitalisation closed at a six-year high of $52.3 billion, reflecting a 63% increase during the year.
Overall, activity on the PSX remained robust throughout the year, the brokerage firm said, “with the average trading volume reaching an unprecedented level of 565 million shares”.
The average traded value was notably elevated at Rs22 billion, marking the highest average since CY07, when it stood at Rs25 billion, it further added.
On the last trading session, traded shares increased by 177 million shares to 1,236.873 million shares from 1,059.02 million shares. The trading value rose to Rs44.218 billion from Rs40.889 billion. Market capital narrowed to Rs14.495 trillion against Rs14.558 trillion. Of the 465 companies active in the session, 235 closed in green, 188 in red and 42 remained unchanged. 
The highest increase was recorded in Bata Pakistan Limited, which rose by Rs104.48 to Rs2,018.85 per share, followed by Unilever Pakistan Foods Limited, which increased by Rs91.16 to Rs21,225.03 per share. A significant decline was noted in Haleon Pakistan Limited, which fell by Rs52.25 to Rs807.67 per share; Shahmurad Sugar Mills Limited followed it, which closed lower by Rs47.31 to Rs425.82 per share.     
As the market heads into 2025, historical data indicates a 4% average return in January over the past 10 years. Investors remain optimistic about continued growth, driven by improved macroeconomic indicators, positive corporate earnings, and further foreign inflows.  
With an 88% annual gain in USD terms, the PSX cemented its position as one of the world’s best-performing markets in 2024, reflecting resilience despite global economic headwinds and local challenges.  
The outlook for the KSE-100 remains positive as the market enters the new year, supported by strong fundamentals, anticipated liquidity flows and government-led reforms. 
In the final trading session, key contributors to index gains included PPL (+2.3%), UBL (+1.03% ), and HBL (+1.7%). However, FFC (-1.51%), MCB (-2.1%), and BAFL (-2.1%) emerged as the largest drags on the index.  
Cnergyico PK remained the volume leader with 213.352 million shares, which closed higher by 41 paisas to Rs7.85 per share. Pace (Pak) Ltd, with 66.219 million shares, followed it, which closed higher by 76 paisas to Rs8.09 per share.

The star of 
The Great British Bake Off
, Paul Hollywood, recently revealed that actress Blake Lively had been texting him amid the ongoing Justin Baldoni lawsuit.
For the unversed, the 58-year-old judge became friends with the 37-year-old star last year after she and her husband, Ryan Reynolds, turned out to be fans of the show, 
The Great British Bake Off.

	

		

	


While having a conversation with 
The Times 
on Tuesday, December 31, Paul said, “I’ve got a lot of time for Blake.”
He added, “She texts occasionally, sort of to catch up on what she's been up to, what Ryan's up to, and it's lovely, because regardless of their job, they're just a normal family, mum and dad to some great kids. They're really nice people.”
Notably, the celebrity chef's comments about texting with Blake come after she filed a legal complaint against her 
It Ends With Us 
co-star and director, Justin Baldoni.
She accused him of sexually harassing her on set and then having his publicists attack her after she complained.
Moving forward, the star of 
Racing Legends
 also mentioned other celebrity fans of the show, including Michael J. Fox, Lynda Carter, and Hugh Jackman.
It is pertinent to mention that Kylie Jenner recently posted a video of herself watching

on a plane and said it was her favourite show.
However, Paul went on to claim that he had “no idea who she was.”"

British actor Kate Beckinsale trigged a debate about the identity of the actors she has mentioned in her latest video meant to express solidarity with Blake Lively after she sued Justin Baldoni.
The star of ""Love & Friendship"", ""Canary Black"" and the Underworld series revealed Beckinsale revealed she has been “assaulted” and “felt up” on film sets, and was insulted and called “a cunt” and “a bitch” when she complained.

	

		

	


In the video, Beckinsale recounts her own negative experiences, saying she has “47 million stories” like this. She says: “At the age of 18, [I was] felt up by somebody that I really trusted on a crew. Went to the lead actress, who’s known for being a supporter of women, and said this has happened and was told, ‘No, it didn’t.’ I went to another actress, crying, and said I’d just been assaulted by this man and again told, ‘No, you haven’t been.’”
Beckinsale says she has twice been put in “unsafe situations” in movie fight scenes. “There’s a certain kind of actor who gets kind of a thrill out of legally being able to harm a woman during a fight sequence. And I was harmed, to the point where there were MRIs proving it. And actually what happened was I was gaslit and made to feel like I was the problem, blamed and ostracised … as soon as I mentioned there was a problem.”
Beckinsale describes the behaviour of a “drunk” male co-star whose inability to learn his lines caused extensive delays, meaning she was unable to see her young daughter during the shoot. “He’s obviously going through something, and I have full sympathy for that, but … the studio’s response was to give me a bike so I could ride around the studio lot while I was waiting. Then, of course, I was called a cunt and a bitch. At one point during a take, I was called ‘You stupid bitch.’”
As thousands of people voiced support for the actress, many people  started guessing the identity of the actor whose behavior was discussed by Kate Bekinsale.
American actor Luke Wilson's name came up during debates on several social media platforms. 
Kate Beckinsale and Luke Wilson worked on  2007 film  Vacancy together and he was one of the men who she referred to in her statement, a claim that could not be independently verified.

Their house will be decorated, and the yard (garden) strung with festive lights. The wealthy residents of Montecito hire interior designers to decorate their houses and trees to perfection.”
But “It would not look good if Meghan who publicizes herself as the all-American homemaker was to hire someone to adorn their house and decorate their tree,” so “she will have done it herself and made the gingerbread house as is traditional in America.""

Ending ambiguity about the resumption of academic activities amid sit-ins in Karachi, the Sindh Education Department on Tuesday announced that educational institutions would reopen across the province on Wednesday (today).
A spokesperson of the provincial education department clarified that education centres would resume academic activities from January 1, 2025 (today) after the winter break.

	

		

	


Public and private schools and colleges generally observe winter vacations from December 21 to 31 every year.
The statement came amid ongoing sit-ins being staged by the Majlis Wahdat-e-Muslimeen (MWM) against the Parachinar issue in Karachi for over a week, resulting in full and partial closure of several arterial roads.
Police launched a crackdown to disperse protesters and managed to clear some roads, however, several localities were still closed for routine traffic movement in the metropolis, including Safari Park on University Road, Kamran Chowrangi, Lasbela, Abbas Town, and others.
The situation became tense at Numaish Chowrangi, M A Jinnah Road when protesters pelted stones at police and torched their six motorcycles and a check post at Numaish Chowrangi, prompting the cops to fire tear gas shells and baton-charge activists.
Several protesters were arrested by the law enforcers who have been shifted to the police station.
The prolonged protests disrupted daily life in the port city as people were unable to travel freely.
Parachinar, located in Kurram, is a tribal district near the Afghan border with a population of around 600,000. It has long been a hotspot for conflict.
Recent clashes, that erupted in November, have killed at least 130 people and triggered a humanitarian crisis, with shortages of medicine and oxygen exacerbated by the closure of the highway connecting Parachinar to Peshawar."

The conversation there began with her saying, “It must be tough for Charles, a man who waited over 70 years for the big gig, to play second fiddle to his son.”

And “The King, for so long overshadowed by his extraordinary mother, now finds himself outperformed by his eldest son with William’s weekend jaunt in Paris another painful reminder of who holds royalty’s trump card,” she added as well before signing off.

The premier said that they have just listen to a ""remarkable and brillinat"" narration from the finance minister, planning minister and deputy prime minister along way very informative presentation.
""The crux is that in the last nine months we negotiated huge challanges and difficulties and through untiring efforts of the federal government provincial governments and our international partners and friends, we have been able to achieve macro economic stability but this is just the beginning of a long journey which would entail sacrifice, blood and sweat to achieve ecnomic growth and finding our lost place among nations,"" he added.

He also congratulated Ahsan Iqbal, Muhammad Aurangzeb and the entire federal cabinet and federal officials, sceretairies, SIFC, and provincial chief minsiters and the governments for their ""great support and cooperation to carve out this homegrown programme.""
""During the journey from default to development and from stable economy to strong economy, we witnessed several phases and faced difficulties,"" he said. 
""When Pakistan was on the verge of collapse, we under the leadership of Nawaz Sharif, and our coalition partners agreed that they would sacrifice their politics for national interest,"" he said.
In 2023, the prime minister said, when the government was making all-out efforts to secure an International Monetary Fund (IMF) programme but ""letters were penned down for obstructing it"". However, he added, the goverment successfully acheived the IMF programme and the rest if history.
He noted that the government also secured another IMF programme, which he reiterated, would be the last of the country. 
PM Shehbaz said that it was a moment to mull why the country had to resort to another IMF package, pointing out the losses of state-owned enterprises, the circular deficit and corruption. 
Speaking of the ""Uraan Pakistan"" programme, the premier highlighted that having achieved macroeconomic stability, the all-out focus would be on boosting growth through targeted investment and reforms.

However, he said the success of the five-year plan which specifically focuses the development in IT, agriculture, exports and mining and mineral sectors was linked with national unity and political harmony and collective efforts by all stakeholders, including political parties, institutions, and the people.
He vowed to make the focused efforts on increasing the annual investment in various sectors to $10 billion. Over the next five years, he said the government’s key priority will be to stimulate economic growth especially through exports, he added.
""The government has achieved the macro-economic stability due to teamwork of the federal cabinet, the deputy prime minister, provincial chief ministers, and the institutions,” he said adding he never experienced this kind of cooperation that he received from the Chief of the Army Staff (COAS).
He told the gathering that the government would create a conducive environment and incentivise the private sector to promote the export-oriented industry as the ""export-led growth will be the pivot of Uraan Pakistan for being the ultimate savior for the Pakistan economy.""
He regretted that a huge chunk of the country’s resources went to waste annually due to corruption, leakages in electricity and gas, and lack of reforms in various sectors.
Similarly, he said the state-owned entities incurred losses of Rs6 trillion during the last one decade, while the electricity and gas sectors had circular debts of around two to three trillion rupees.
Highlighting the positive macroeconomic indicators he mentioned inflation eased to 5%, average exports increase by 10%, a surge in remittances by 24%, and IT export boosted by 34% during last five months, besides the policy rate decline to 13%.
Calling ""solar name of the game"", he emphasised the importance of clean and affordable energy sources and a special focus on solar energy.
He said Pakistan could regain its lost glory through self-introspection, learning lessons from past mistakes, and marching forward as Team Pakistan with unity of thoughts and actions.
He also defended his government’s re-negotiation with independent power producers (IPPs) saying that it was time the elite class also sacrificed for the country.
'Improving economic indicators'
At the outset of the ceremony, the finance minister — while addressing the participants — said that the country was on the path of development under the leadership of PM Shehbaz Sharif, expressing satisfaction over the macroeconomic indicators.
He pointed out that the Karachi Interbank Offered Rate (Kibor), a benchmark rate for lending to consumers and businesses, is close to 12%, which he said was helping the private sector.
""The country is receiving direct foreign investment at a rapid pace,"" he said, emphasising the importance of the Special Investment Facilitation Council (SIFC) for securing investment.
Furthermore, he said, the Pakistan Stock Exchange (PSX) is setting records day by day and has become the second largest market in the world, while the inflation rate has come down from 38% to 5%.
Aurangzeb said that the incumbent government was not mulling planning but implementing. ""The Federal Board of Revenue's (FBR) transformation is being carried out,"" he said, saying that they will stabilise the export-oriented economy.
He added that the country was heading towards stable growth.
Speaking of the tax system, the finance minister said that the authorities were carrying out reforms in tax policy, which according to him, was being separated with tax collection. ""The Tax Policy Unit will be run with the help of the government and the private sector,"" he said, stressing the need to ""stop the leakage of taxes"".
He also said the country would achieve more than 6% Gross Domestic Product (GDP) growth by 2028. ""Pakistan has achieved an account surplus after 24 years,"" he added.
The minister concluded by stressing that the private sector has to drive the country and ""we have to stand up as a nation"".
What is 'Uraan Pakistan'?
In a statement, Minister for Information and Broadcasting Attaullah Tarar said that the Uraan Pakistan is an all inclusive agenda through which the journey of economic development will be undertaken. He said this economic reforms agenda is for the development of Pakistan and its people.
He stated that Pakistan has moved from the verge of default to stability and is now on the path to progress. 
According to its website, Uraan Pakistan is a transformative initiative designed to spotlight and advance crucial projects and reforms set forth in the 5Es National Economic Transformation Plan. The strategy aims to rejuvenate Pakistan’s economy, promote sustainable development, and drive inclusive growth.

WASHINGTON: The United States (US) on Tuesday imposed sanctions on entities in Iran and Russia, accusing them of attempting to interfere in the US election this year.

Rana Sanaullah calls for unity for Pakistan's development.
PM's aide urges opposition to refrain from ""onslaught"".
PTI senator stresses need for supremacy of rule of law.

	

		

	


ISLAMABAD: Referring to the newly-launched five-year National Economic Transformation Plan ""Uraan Pakistan"", PM's aide on Political Affairs, Rana Sanaullah on Tuesday said that Pakistan's ""uraan"" is certain if the opposition party Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) agreed on the charter of the economy.
""Political stability only possible through negotiations [...] we will have to come on the same page for Pakistan's development,"" the ruling PML-N leader said while speaking on Geo News programme 'Capital Talk'. 
The Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N)-led federal government kick-started the talks with the arch-rival PTI earlier this month at the Parliament House, following months of heightened political tensions.
The PTI negotiation committee had set a January 31 deadline after meeting its party founder at Adiala Jail a day earlier, reiterating the demands of a judicial probe into the May 9 riots and the November 26 late-night crackdown and release of ""political prisoners"".
The two sides are set to hold multiple sessions to reach a solution with their next meeting scheduled to take place on January 2. 
Speaking on the show today, Sanaullah noted that political talks would start from January 2, urging the opposition to protest peacefully and refrain from ""onslaught"". ""A limit should not be crossed during the protests,"" he added. 
Furthermore, he asked the opposition to provide justice to Pakistan before seeking justice for any individual. 
In response to a question, the PM's aide said that the country has witnessed slight improvement and a reduction in inflation. ""As a result of our efforts, Pakistan can return to its 2017 position,"" he added.
Earlier in the day, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif launched the five-year National Economic Transformation Plan ""Uraan Pakistan"", which aims to achieve sustainable export-led economic growth based on 5Es – exports, e-Pakistan, environment, energy, equity, and empowerment.
'Hybrid system'
Speaking on the same show, PTI Senator Barrister Ali Zafar said that political stability was only possible when the people of Pakistan get their rights inscribed in the Constitution. ""A hybrid system would not bring stability even in 2025,"" he added.
He regretted that the terror-related incidents increased manifold in 2024, calling for mutual consultation to resolve the terror issue.
Expressing doubt on the government's claim of economic growth, Zafar said that the country's economy witnessed a growth of only 0.9% in 2024, while the agriculture and IT industries suffered heavily. 
Stressing the need for supremacy of the rule of law, the senator said that law must be equal for all citizens. ""The people should have the right to peacefully protest and the government should not stop them,"" he added. 
In response to a question, he said that opposition and politics are kept aside during talks. ""It is better not to issue statement against each other during negotiations,"" he added."

The 
Wanted
 vocalist, Max George, recently opened up about experiencing a ""flicking feeling"" in his chest after undergoing major surgery for a previously undiagnosed heart condition.
According to 
Daily Mail
, the 36-year-old singer had a pacemaker fitted after he was hospitalised earlier this month for heart problems.

	

		

	


He stayed in the hospital for a long time and was released on Christmas Day.
On Tuesday, George shared on his Instagram Stories that he felt a strange sensation in his chest, saying that the doctors had no idea what it was.
After filling his followers in on his condition, he went on to ask them if they had ever felt the same thing as he got ready for a check-up.
In his video, George can be heard quipping, “I'm in the hospital tomorrow for another checkup because I've been getting this flicking feeling in the left side of my chest. I'm actually getting it right now.”
The 
Lightning
 crooner added, “I was wondering if you guys knew what it might be or you've experienced it yourself because the doctors aren't too sure.”
He further explained by guessing, “Maybe it's touching a nerve and it'll go away in time, or they might have to move a wire slightly, but I'm all ears because all I'm doing is research.”
“I know nothing about pacemakers. Any information I could get would be most appreciated,” George concluded."

As the nation is all set to welcome 2025, First Lady Aseefa Bhutto Zardari appealed to the public to avoid a ""deadly"" act of aerial firing on the New Year's Eve which could turn celebration into tragedies.
Aseefa, daughter of President Asif Ali Zardari, started a trend on X — #
CelebrateResponsibly 
and #
SayNoToAerialFiring
 — to spread awareness among the masses ahead of the new year's celebrations.

	

		

	


""When ushering in the New Year, remember to #
CelebrateResponsibly
,"" the Pakistan Peoples Party’s lawmaker wrote.
“Aerial firing is not just reckless — its deadly. Your stray bullet can end an innocent life, turning celebration into senseless tragedies,” she adding.
“Choose safety, and let everyone enjoy and celebrate the New Year in peace. #
SayNoToAerialFiring
,” she concluded.
@AseefaBZ
Aseefa's campaign earned praises from netizens and the masses as it garnered hundreds of likes and reposts.
Unfortunately, every year on the eve of New Year, scores of people get injured or killed in celebratory firing despite the authorities' taking different measures.
Sindh's senior minister Sharjeel Memon also took forward Aseefa's campaign and said in a statement that people should celebrate the new year but they must avoid aerial firing.
He added that the government was taking strict actions to curb such incidents and appealed to the public to assist the administration to create a safe environment.
In the Sindh capital, local administration has imposed Section 144 with a complete ban on arms, aerial firing and use of fire crackers for a period of two days besides promising strict actions against the violators.
Like other parts of the world, the country would celebrate the arrival of 2025 tonight with joy, music, and spectacular fireworks displays lighting up the skies.
In Pakistan, the festivities are more private and subdued compared to public events.
New Year's Eve remains one of the symbolic occasions in key Pakistani cities like Islamabad, Lahore and Karachi where tens of thousands enjoy fireworks, music and light show.

Similarly, the prices of kerosene and light diesel were also slashed by Rs3.32 and Rs2.78 to Rs161.66 per litre and Rs148.95 per litre, respectively.
Petrol is mainly used in private transportation, small vehicles, rickshaws, and two-wheelers. Higher fuel prices significantly impact the budgets of the members of the middle and lower-middle classes, who primarily consume petrol for commuting. On the other hand, a significant portion of the transport sector relies on high-speed diesel.
Its price is considered inflationary since it is predominantly used in heavy goods transport vehicles, trucks, buses, trains, and agricultural machinery such as tractors, tube wells, and threshers.
The consumption of high-speed diesel particularly contributes to the increased prices of vegetables and other food items."

Minister for Petroleum Musadik Malik has rejected media reports claiming that the federal cabinet has greenlighted the sale of a 15% stake in the Reko Diq project, worth $540 million, to the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA) under the Inter-Governmental Commercial Transactions Act.

Earlier in the day, it was reported that the federal cabinet had given a go-ahead to the much-awaited sale of a 15% stake of the federal government in the Reko Diq project. 
""The KSA will make payment in two installments. In the first phase, the KSA will acquire a 10% stake in the project, for which $330 million will be transferred to Pakistan. The remaining 5% stake will be purchased in the second phase for $210 million,” the report stated.

Meghan Markle and Prince Harry’s new Netflix show Polo has been bombarded with bad reviews from both audiences and critics, and a streaming business insider is questioning why Netflix keeps throwing money at the former working royals.
“How much money is too much money to spend on Harry and Meghan? That’s a tricky question, because Netflix has almost unlimited capital and has already thrown tens of millions of dollars at this couple,” said the insider in conversation with
 In Touch
 magazine. 

	

		

	


The Guardian 
bashed the show as an “unintentionally hilarious” profile of “the world’s stupidest sport,” and

 published a brutal review titled “Harry and Meghan’s Projects Can’t Stop Flopping.”
“The arbitrage for Netflix comes with all the press attention the Sussexes get, especially in England and the U.S., which are two of Netflix’s biggest markets,” noted the source.
“Polo is shaping up to be one of the most disliked streaming shows of the year,” the tipster remarked, adding that it “seems to underline how out-of-touch Harry and Meghan compared to your typical Netflix subscriber.”
The source argued that the continued support for Harry and Meghan in T.V business is taking opportunities away from those who deserve them.
“There’s not a lot of sympathy for them,” the source noted, adding that “even among the professionals in the T.V. business, they see their mostly pointless Netflix shows as taking opportunities away from creators and talent who are T.V. professionals with legitimately strong ideas”
According to the streaming insider, the new flop “puts them in a dangerous spot, because they still have yet to deliver a rock-solid hit for Netflix that wins over their critics.” 
“We’ll see next year how many more chances they really get, but the critics have spoken and nobody is impressed. If they want to keep making television, they need to tackle a subject matter that’s relevant and they need to make the project actually entertaining,” advised the mole.
“It's a lot easier said than done, but if they can’t pull that off, it’s only going to marginalize them further from the Hollywood community,” said the source, concluding their remarks about Harry and Meghan’s Netflix deal."
